# AssetManagementSystem
A simplified Asset Management System that simulates how physical assets (like equipment, vehicles, or tools) are managed, tracked, and maintained using Maximo. This project will focus on building an interface for integrating with a Maximo-like system, handling data in SQL, XML, JSON, and incorporating Agile practices.
